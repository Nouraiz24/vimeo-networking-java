/**
 * An interface that provides the following ways to authenticate with the Vimeo API:
 * - Client credentials
 * - Google
 * - Facebook
 * - Code grant
 * - Email login
 * - Email join
 * - Pin code
 * - Logout
 *
 * If no authentication is performed, by default basic authentication will be used for requests made by this SDK. It is
 * advised that client credentials are used instead of basic authentication if the consumer intends to use the API as a
 * "logged out" user. If the consumer intends to use the API as a "logged in" user, then obtaining credentials using the
 * code grant mechanism is the way to authenticate.
 *
 * Create an instance of the [Authenticator] by using its invoke function as follows.
 * ```
 * val authenticator = Authenticator(Configuration)
 * ```
 *
 * If the consumer does not want to manage the instance of the [Authenticator] themselves, they can utilize the
 * singleton instance.
 * ```
 * Authenticator.initialize(Configuration)
 * val instance = Authenticator.instance()
 * ```
 *
 * In order to obtain client credentials, make a request as follows.
 * ```
 * authenticator.authenticateWithClientCredentials(vimeoCallback(
 *     onSuccess = { authResponse: VimeoResponse.Success<VimeoAccount> -> }
 *     onError = { error: VimeoResponse.Error -> }
 * ))
 * ```
 * Once this request succeeds, all subsequent requests with the client will use the token obtained. The [Authenticator]
 * automatically stores and manages the logged in account using the [AccountStore] which is provided during
 * configuration.
 *
 * In order to log in using a code grant, follow this flow. Note: [VimeoApiConfiguration.codeGrantRedirectUri] must be
 * set and must be registered at [https://developer.vimeo.com/apps].
 * ```
 * // Create the URI to log in.
 * val loginUri = createCodeGrantAuthorizationUri(requestCode = "1234567")
 *
 * // Open the URI in a browser (Android shown here).
 * val intent = Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse(loginUri))
 * startActivity(intent)
 * ```
 * Once the user logs in at the URI, the API will redirect back to the redirect URI mentioned above. Note: Android
 * consumers should specify an `intent-filter` in the manifest for the redirect URI so that the app can be called back
 * with it.
 * ```
 * // Use the URI the browser redirects back to to log in.
 * authenticator.authenticateWithCodeGrant(redirectedUri, vimeoCallback(
 *     onSuccess = { authResponse: VimeoResponse.Success<VimeoAccount> -> }
 *     onError = { error: VimeoResponse.Error -> }
 * ))
 * ```
 *
 * See [https://developer.vimeo.com/api/authentication] for more information about the different authentication
 * approaches.
